Rorschach a custom watchface for the Pebble smart watch.

Design inspired by the [Rorschach 2 e-paper watch watch from TokyoFlash](http://blog.tokyoflash.com/2013/03/rorschach-2-e-paper-watch-update/).

The hours are found in the top right, and the minutes are found in the bottom left. The other quadrants are reflections of these.

Supports 12/24hr displays. Slide in animation has been turned off because they look clunky when using transparent images.
